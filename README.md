# Assignment 1 - Core Java Constructs

There are four parts for assignment 1:
- [ ] Part 1 - Code Tracing with short answers to trace through code segments in Java
- [ ] Part 2 - Fixing mistakes to understand common errors in Java syntax and interpret error messages accordingly
- [ ] Part 3 - Writing methods using core java constructs
- [ ] Part 4 - Starting your game development to put your learning into practice in a creative way

## Part 1: Code Tracing
In part 1, you will read and interpret Java code and trace programs by hand. To complete this part, print and complete the questions in `Assignment1_Part1.pdf` by hand.

Goals of this part:
 * Comprehend Java code and understand how to trace through code segments in Java
 * Practice with memory models and tracing programs by hand
 * Understanding data type conversions, return statements, and core Java syntax

## Part 2: Fixing Mistakes
Complete the questions in `Mistakes.java`. By the end of this task, `Mistakes.java` should compile and run smoothly.

Goals of this part:
 * Understand common errors in Java syntax and interpret error messages accordingly.
 * Understand Javadoc and how it should be formatted for this course.

## Part 3: Writing Code
In this section, you will write your own methods and first Java program to model a well-known game. This requires effective command of Java constructs, 
including some APIs we introduced in class (Scanner and Random). You will continue to build your skills with loops, conditionals, and more Java constructs throughout the semester. Complete the file `RPS.java` for this task.

Note: There is some code in this starter file that we have not yet covered in class (arrays). You do not need to write any array-related code to complete this assignment. This is a chance to see an up-coming topic. 

Goals of this part:
 * Understand how to compile and run a simple Java program to interact with user input.
 * Gain experience with BlueJ, output, and interacting with Java programs.
 * Write effective Javadoc to ensure outside users can easily comprehend the purpose of code.
 * Create a Java class that manages specific state and behaviors.
 
## Part 4: Introduction to Adventure Games
Throughout the PSETs and assignments in this course, you will slowly develop your own text-based adventure game. You are welcome to choose whatever theme you'd like, and you can add additional functionality unique to your theme as the course goes along. This project will be broken down for you into manageable parts, and we're excited to see your creativity and play your games at the end of the semester. This is meant to provide you with hands-on project experience, which you may include on your resume or GitHub profile in the future. For this PSET, we'd like you to start brainstorming a theme by playing the text-based games we've provided and reflecting on what aspects you might include in your game. Additionally, you will get a first look at what adventure game source code might look like.

### Task 1: Charting Your Adventure Game
In this task, we'd like you to draw a map of your adventure game. According to 
whatever theme you've chosen, chart a map (on paper!) of your game's world. 
Include the following elements:
 * At least 4 rooms, with one room that is initially locked.
 * At least one treasure chest per room, with the key to the locked room inside one
   of them, as well as at least two treasures (some food, some other treasures) 
   per chest.
 * At least 3 animals, in multiple rooms, with differing values for the damage 
   they can do.
 * Designate one room as the starting location, and number your rooms starting from 
   zero.
Feel free to be as artistic (or not) as you'd like, and you can include any extra 
elements that you'd like.
When you're finished, take a picture of your map and upload a .png or .jpeg file to 
this repository.

### Task 2: First Adventure Game File
To begin your adventure game project, create a new BlueJ project (Open BlueJ >
Project > New Project) in a directory of your choice. Then, copy the provided 
file Game.java and follow the instructions. When you're done working in your 
project folder, copy and paste the code you've written back into this repository.

## Submission
Submit your files to Gradescope.
